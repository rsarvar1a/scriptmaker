otherNightReminder: The Harlot points at any living player. Then, put the Harlot to
  sleep. Wake the chosen player, show them the *THIS CHARACTER SELECTED YOU* token,
  then the Harlot token. That player either nods their head yes or shakes their head
  no. If they nodded their head yes, wake the Harlot and show them the chosen player's
  character token. Then, you may decide that both players die.
