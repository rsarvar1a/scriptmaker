ability: 'Once per game, at night*, choose a dead player: they regain their ability
  until dusk.'
edition: snv
flavor: I collect many things. Hair. Teeth. Clothes. Fragments of poems. The dreams
  of lost lovers. My secret arts are not for you to know but my fee is a mere pittance.
  Bring me the blood of a noblewoman who died of heartbreak under a full moon, and
  you shall have your answers.
