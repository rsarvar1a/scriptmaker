ability: On your 1st night, you gain a Townsfolk ability (if good), or a Minion ability
  (if evil).
edition: bmr
firstNight: 9
firstNightReminder: Show the Apprentice the *YOU ARE* card, then a Townsfolk or Minion
  token. In the Grimoire, replace the Apprentice token with that character token,
  and put the Apprentice's *IS THE APPRENTICE* reminder by that character token.
flavor: For years have I traveled, studying the ways of The Craft. Which craft, you
  ask? Simply that of the simple folk. Nothing to worry about. Not yet.
