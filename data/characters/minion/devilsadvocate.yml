ability: 'Each night, choose a living player (different to last night): if executed
  tomorrow, they don''t die.'

firstNight: 39
firstNightReminder: 'The Devil''s Advocate chooses a living player. :reminder:'
flavor: My client, should the objection be overruled, pleads innocent by virtue of
  the prosecution's non-observance of statute 27.B - incorrect or misleading conjugation
  of a verb. The fact that nine of the jury died last night is simply prima facie,
  which is, as Wills vs Thule set precedent for, further reason to acquit.
