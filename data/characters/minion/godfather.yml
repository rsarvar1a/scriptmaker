firstNightReminder: Show the character tokens of all in-play Outsiders.
flavor: Normally, it's just business. But when you insult my daughter, you insult
  me. And when you insult me, you insult my family. You really should be more careful
  - it would be a shame if you had an unfortunate accident.
