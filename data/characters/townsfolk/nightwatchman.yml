firstNight: 69
firstNightReminder: 'The Nightwatchman might choose a player :reminder: Put the Nightwatchman
  to sleep. Wake the target and show the *THIS PLAYER IS* and Nightwatchman tokens
  and point to the Nightwatchman.'
flavor: The night is cold and lonely, but I have the moon, the stars, the crisp wind

  flickers behind a murky window...
