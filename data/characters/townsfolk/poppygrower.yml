firstNightReminder: Do not do the Minion Info and Demon Info steps. Wake the Demon,

  tokens that are not in play.
flavor: In the hidden groves of the deep forest, the black poppy dwells. To see its
  revelry is to be enchanted. To smell its thick aroma is to be lost forever, a slave
  to the gods of light and dark.
