jinxes:
- id: legion
  reason: The Magician wakes with Legion and might register as evil. Legion knows
    if a Magician is in play, but not which player it is.
- id: marionette
  reason: If the Magician is alive, the Demon doesn't know which neighbor is the Marionette.
- id: spy
  reason: When the Spy sees the Grimoire, the Demon and Magician's character tokens
    are removed.
- id: vizier
  reason: If the Vizier is in play, the Magician has no ability but is immune to the
    Vizier's ability.
- id: widow
  reason: When the Widow sees the Grimoire, the Demon and Magician's character tokens
    are removed.
- id: wraith
  reason: After each execution, the living Magician may publicly guess a living player
    as the Wraith. If correct, the Demon must choose the Wraith tonight.
