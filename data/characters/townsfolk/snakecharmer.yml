ability: 'Each night, choose an alive player: a chosen Demon swaps characters & alignments
  with you & is then poisoned.'
edition: snv
firstNight: 36
firstNightReminder: 'The Snake Charmer chooses a player. If they chose the Demon:
  Show the *YOU ARE* & Demon tokens. Give a thumbs down. Swap the Snake Charmer &
  Demon tokens. Put the old Snake Charmer to sleep. Wake the old Demon. Show the *YOU
  ARE* and Snake Charmer tokens & give a thumbs up. :reminder:'
flavor: Effendi... I am but a humble man, but my pipe is golden and a single tune
  will tame the wildest djinn, Inshallah. They say that greed hangs more men than
  rope. But not I, Effendi... not I.
