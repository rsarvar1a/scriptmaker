firstNightReminder: 'The Engineer might choose Minions or Demons. :reminder: If they
  do: Put the Engineer to sleep. Wake a target, show them the *YOU ARE* token and
  their new character token, then put that target to sleep. Repeat for all players
  that changed characters.'
flavor: If it bends, great. If it breaks, well, it probably needed fixing anyway.
