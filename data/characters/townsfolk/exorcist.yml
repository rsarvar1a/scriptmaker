ability: 'Each night*, choose a player (different to last night): the Demon, if chosen,
  learns who you are then doesn''t wake tonight.'
edition: bmr
flavor: We cast you out, every unclean spirit, every satanic power, every onslaught
  of the infernal adversary, every legion, every diabolical group and sect, in the
  name and by the power of Our Lord Jesus Christ. We command you, begone and fly far
  from the Church of God, from the souls made by God in His image and redeemed by
  the precious blood of the divine Lamb.
